## Usage Examples

#### Use Built-in Attacks

OpenAttack builds in some commonly used text classification models such as LSTM and BERT as well as datasets such as [SST](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html) for sentiment analysis and [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) for natural language inference. You can effortlessly conduct adversarial attacks against the built-in victim models on the datasets.

The following code snippet shows how to use a genetic algorithm-based attack model ([Alzantot et al., 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1316.pdf)) to attack BERT on the SST dataset:

```python
import OpenAttack as oa
# choose a trained victim classification model
victim = oa.DataManager.load("Victim.BERT.SST")
# choose an evaluation dataset 
dataset = oa.DataManager.load("Dataset.SST.sample")
# choose Genetic as the attacker and initialize it with default parameters
attacker = oa.attackers.GeneticAttacker() 
# prepare for attacking
attack_eval = oa.attack_evals.DefaultAttackEval(attacker, victim)
# launch attacks and print attack results 
attack_eval.eval(dataset, visualize=True)
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Customized Victim Model</strong></summary>

The following code snippet shows how to use the genetic algorithm-based attack model to attack a customized sentiment analysis model (a statistical model built in NLTK) on SST.

```python
import OpenAttack as oa
import numpy as np
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# configure access interface of the customized victim model
class MyClassifier(oa.Classifier):
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    # access to the classification probability scores with respect input sentences
    def get_prob(self, input_): 
        rt = []
        for sent in input_:
            rs = self.model.polarity_scores(sent)
            prob = rs["pos"] / (rs["neg"] + rs["pos"])
            rt.append(np.array([1 - prob, prob]))
        return np.array(rt)

# choose the costomized classifier as the victim model
victim = MyClassifier()
# choose an evaluation dataset 
dataset = oa.DataManager.load("Dataset.SST.sample")
# choose Genetic as the attacker and initialize it with default parameters
attacker = oa.attackers.GeneticAttacker()
# prepare for attacking
attack_eval = oa.attack_evals.DefaultAttackEval(attacker, victim)
# launch attacks and print attack results 
attack_eval.eval(dataset, visualize=True)
```

## Attack Models

According to the level of perturbations imposed on original input, textual adversarial attack models can be categorized into sentence-level, word-level, character-level attack models. 

According to the accessibility to the victim model, textual adversarial attack models can be categorized into `gradient`-based, `score`-based, `decision`-based and `blind` attack models.

> [TAADPapers](https://github.com/thunlp/TAADpapers) is a paper list which summarizes almost all the papers concerning textual adversarial attack and defense. You can have a look at this list to find more attack models.

Currently OpenAttack includes 15 typical attack models against text classification models that cover **all** attack types.

## Toolkit Design

Considering the significant distinctions among different attack models, we leave considerable freedom for the skeleton design of attack models, and focus more on streamlining the general processing of adversarial attacking and the common components used in attack models.

OpenAttack has 7 main modules: 

<img src="./docs/source/images/toolkit_framework.png" alt="toolkit_framework" style="zoom:40%;" />

* **TextProcessor**: processing the original text sequence to assist attack models in generating adversarial examples;
* **Victim**: wrapping victim models;
* **Attacker**: comprising various attack models;
* **AttackAssist**: packing different word/character substitution methods that are used in word-/character-level attack models and some other components used in sentence-level attack models like the paraphrasing model;
* **Metric**: providing several adversarial example quality metrics that can serve as either the constraints on the adversarial examples during attacking or evaluation metrics for evaluating adversarial attacks;
* **AttackEval**: evaluating textual adversarial attacks from attack effectiveness, adversarial example quality and attack efficiency;
* **DataManager**: managing all data and saved models that are used in other modules.
